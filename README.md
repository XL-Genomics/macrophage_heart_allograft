## The Macrophage Landscape Across the Lifespan of a Human Cardiac Allograft

Much of our knowledge of organ rejection after transplantation is derived from rodent studies. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to investigate the inflammatory milieu in pediatric cardiac allografts at different stages post transplantation. We distinguished donor from recipient-derived cardiac cells using naturally occurring genetic variants embedded in snRNA-seq data.
Our data reveal an imbalance of donor-derived and recipient-derived macrophages in the pediatric cardiac allograft after heart transplantation. Importantly, we observed a clear functional dichotomy of recipient-derived macrophages. At different stages after heart transplantation, these cells contribute to acute adverse damage to the myocardium and chronic maladaptation.



The computational work was motivated by 3 main objectives: 

1) Provide a single nuclei atlas of the human heart

2) Evaluate cell-type molecular and compositional information at increased spatial resolution.

3) Explore spatial dependencies between cell-types and molecular processes to generate descriptions of the tissue organization during disease.
