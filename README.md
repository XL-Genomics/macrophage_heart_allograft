## The Macrophage Landscape Across the Lifespan of a Human Cardiac Allograft

Much of our knowledge of organ rejection after transplantation is derived from rodent studies. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to investigate the inflammatory milieu in pediatric cardiac allografts at different stages post transplantation. We distinguished donor from recipient-derived cardiac cells using naturally occurring genetic variants embedded in snRNA-seq data.
Our data reveal an imbalance of donor-derived and recipient-derived macrophages in the pediatric cardiac allograft after heart transplantation. Importantly, we observed a clear functional dichotomy of recipient-derived macrophages. At different stages after heart transplantation, these cells contribute to acute adverse damage to the myocardium and chronic maladaptation.



The computational framework includes: 

1) Initial processing of sequencing data and QC.

2) Integration of transplanted heart data with control, cell identity annotationa and visulization.

3) Exploration and investigation of functional differences in gene expression and cell-state shift that may have pathological implications.
